* I've done a little traveling

* Usually, people have one question:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear) :frag_idx (1 2)
 - What do you do?
 - They usually mean: How can I do that to?
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
    + (for free?)
    + (Living the 'first class' lifestyle?)
* You can
  - Airline points programs
  - Thanks to the intersection of a few different systems, it's quite reasonable to take 1/2 trips a year for <$500
    - (In first class!)
    - (Not quite free)
* Acquisition
  - Credit Card Sign-up Bonuses
    - Sign-up and cancel
      - There is a small credit hit, but it only lasts a year (mine is still excellent after doing this for a couple of years)
    - Minimum spend
    - Make sure to exercise self control
  - Miles
    - Mileage Runs
    - Regularly Frequent Flying
* Spending
  - Airline Alliances
    - Star Alliance (United)
    - One World Alliance (American)
    - Sky Team (Delta)
    - Some out of alliance airlines
      - Emirates!
  - Zone Boundaries
    - Kind of confusing, look at maps
  - Open Jaws?
  - Stopovers!
  - You have to pay a little ($)
* Where to start
  - Get your frequent flier accounts!
    - You can make foreign accounts at the last minute for transfers
  - Move your spend to one credit card (Chase Sapphire is a very popular option)
    - Be responsible!
      - This system exists because credit cards are betting on you carrying a balance
    - Determine how valuable a mile is to you
      -  1 -  2 cents is where most people sit
* Singapore Air Business Class (on my way to Hack Reactor!)
